@article{Ozkan22,
	abstract = {Summary
Climate change calls for adaptation of negative emission technologies such as direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) to lower the global warming impacts of greenhouse gases. Recently, elevated global interests to the DAC technologies prompted implementation of new tax credits and new policies worldwide that motivated the existing DAC companies and prompted the startup boom. There are presently 19 DAC plants operating worldwide, capturing more than 0.01 Mt CO2/year. DAC active plants capturing in average 10,000 tons of CO2 annually are still in their infancy and are expensive. DAC technologies still need to improve in three areas: 1) Contactor, 2) Sorbent, and 3) Regeneration to drive down the costs. Technology-based economic development in all three areas are required to achieve <$100/ton of CO2 which makes DAC economically viable. Current DAC cost is about 2–6 times higher than the desired cost and depends highly on the source of energy used. In this review, we present the current status of commercial DAC technologies and elucidate the five pillars of technology including capture technologies, their energy demand, final costs, environmental impacts, and political support. We explain processing steps for liquid and solid carbon capture technologies and indicate their specific energy requirements. DAC capital and operational cost based on plant power energy sources, land and water needs of DAC are discussed in detail. At 0.01 Mt CO2/year capture capacity, DAC alone faces a challenge to meet the rates of carbon capture described in the goals of the Paris Agreement with 1.5–2°C of global warming. However, DAC may partially help to offset difficult to avoid annual emissions from concrete (∼8\%), transportation (∼24\%), iron-steel industry (∼11\%), and wildfires (∼0.8\%).},

@article{Zhao21,
	abstract = {A comprehensive economic analysis of twenty light olefin production pathways has been performed, covering current and promising processes from fossil (petroleum, coal and natural gas) and renewable resources (biomass and CO2). Taking steam cracking of naphtha as the benchmark, this study gives an economic perspective and points out the bottleneck in different olefin production pathways. The assessment indicates that nearly all renewable pathways are economically unattractive currently and the raw material cost accounts for dominant contribution in most pathways, especially in the oil-, natural gas- and CO2-derived pathways. For the ways of methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-propylene, fossil pathways are cost-competitive according to the date of current Chinese market prices. However, the price of feedstock hydrogen needs to be lowered by 55\% to fill the cost gap between CO2-derived pathways and the benchmark. For the ways of oxidative coupling of methane and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to olefins, fossil pathways enable cost-competitive processes by feedstock price fall, but further process improvement is required to approach benchmark in renewable pathways. Conditionally, a decrease in ethanol price by 45\% can make ethanol dehydration pathway profitable. In addition, costs can reduce by 4\%–23\% in different pathways as the production scales expand from 100 to 1000 kt/a, resulting in a change from high cost to economic profit for some of the pathways. The results quantify the need for improvements on feedstock price, scale size and process improvement to achieve competitive production costs.},
