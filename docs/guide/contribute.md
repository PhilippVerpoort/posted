# How to contribute to POSTED

Contributions to the data curated in POSTED and to the functionalities implemented in its code are very much encouraged and greatly appreciated.

## By creating a pull request on GitHub

POSTED — including its public database and the source code of its underlying Python framework — is managed on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/PhilippVerpoort/posted).

You can contribute your data directly by:
* [Forking POSTED on GitHub](https://github.com/PhilippVerpoort/posted/fork)
* Clone your fork and make local edits
* Commit your changes to your forked repository
* Create a pull request [here](https://github.com/PhilippVerpoort/posted/pulls)

Generic information on creating pull requests can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

This method has many advantages, e.g. automated testing procedures, discussing changes through the GitHub interface, full public transparency, etc.

## By sending a data file to the maintainers

GitHub pull requests may be a barrier for contribution to some users. We therefore also encourage users to send us their raw data directly.

Data files can be sent directly via email to `philipp DOT verpoort AT pik MINUS potsdam DOT de` (email address obfuscated to protect against web crawlers). Files can be attached directly to emails (if less than 10 MB in size) or uploaded to an appropriate file-sharing service. Files may be shared as comma-separated value (CSV) ASCII files, as XLSX files (typically created using Microsoft® Excel® or compatible software), or ODS files (typically created using LibreOffice™, Apache OpenOffice™, or other compatible software).

Contributors are encouraged to try to use the correct [format](format.md) when providing their data. However, the data does not have to be in the perfect and final format yet when sharing. The authors of POSTED are happy to help convert data to the correct format.
