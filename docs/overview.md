# Overview

## Purpose and aims
The development of the POSTED framework pursues several goals:

**Obtain a comprehensive collection of techno-economic data.** The data needed for techno-economic assessments and various types of modelling is often scattered across many sources and formats. One aim of POSTED is to collect all required data in one place with a consistent format. This data will forever be publicly available under a permissive licence in order to overcome existing barriers of collaboration.

**Make data easily available for manipulation and techno-economic assessments.** Techno-economic data often comes in the form of Excel Spreadsheets, which is difficult to work with when performing assessments. Calculating the levelized cost of production or comparing parameters across different sources should be easy and straightforward with a few lines of code.

**Make data sources traceable and transparent.** When working with techno-economic data, the origin and underlying assumptions are often intransparent and hard to trace back. By being explicit about sources and reporting data only in the original units, the process of data curation becomes more open and transparent. Through the development and explication of clear standards, the misunderstandings can be avoided.
Be extendible to meet users’ requirements. The POSTED database can be extended, allowing users’ to meet the requirements of their own projects.
